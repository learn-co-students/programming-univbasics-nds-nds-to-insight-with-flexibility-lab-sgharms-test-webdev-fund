  # and accumulate the returned Array of movies into a new Array that's
  # returned by this method.

  #
  # RETURN:

  # Array of Hashes where each Hash represents a movie; however, they should all have a
  # :director_name key. This addition can be done by using the provided
  # movie_with_director_name method

  # each studio.
  #
  # INPUT:
  # * collection: Array of Hashes where each Hash where each Hash represents a movie
  #
  # RETURN:
  #
  # Hash whose keys are the studio names and whose values are the sum
  # total of all the worldwide_gross numbers for every movie in the input Hash

  # GOAL: For each director, find their :movies Array and stick it in a new Array

  # INPUT:
  # * source: An Array of Hashes containing director information including

  #
  # RETURN:
  #
  # Array of Arrays containing all of a director's movies. Each movie will need
  # to have a :director_name key added to it.
